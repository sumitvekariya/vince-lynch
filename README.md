---------------------------
Previously:
- I was lucky enough to have a grandfather who wanted me to get involved with computers from a young age. (dos, basic etc)
- By age 10, this had led me to creating some excel macro's for accounting (various businesses) + a local running race. (some visual basic)
- By 14-16 I was developing ecommerce stores in php + mysql, and got a job in a local computer shop creating websites.
- By 16-17 I developed an interest in hypnosis + magic, that grew from childhood. Randomly being an early bloomer, internet savvy, and a heavy forum user, also with a strong self-belief in entrepreneurship. I somehow with the help of some amazing colleagues became widely considered the founder of the largest hypnosis movement in human history, and ended up teaching over 10,000 students & delivered talks (universities, governments, television, private) and conventions (USA, EU, AU), across 29 cities around the world with various affiliate campaigns and online training programs for ourselves and various partners. (2k+ a day offline, Â£500-800 p.d online)
- By 2011, Despite it being a primary goal, I had largely missed the opporunity to turn into a full blown lead-gen social media advertising business (would have made 10m-50m)
- I quit hypnosis, and I made attempts to resolve purely the internet-advertising side that I previously didn't adapt quickly enough to, I did various advertising/seo campaigns with a colleague, and to some success managed to acheive the same kind of earnings I was getting with the original biz. (too late, but some big successes, 1.5k a day, once had a +$43k day. Once had a -Â£23k day)
- By 2013, after building various web solutions both internally (within affiliate space) my role became full time software engineering + manging the outsourced team.
